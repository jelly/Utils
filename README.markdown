# Jelly's Utils
This git repo contains various scripts I wrote.


-   flashvideo: plays a flash video loaded in firefox with mplayer 
-   mplayer.tv: a script to start mplayer on my TV instead of my dual monitor setup
-   SeperateX: creates a seperate X  session for games
-   repo-signed.py: python3 script that shows how much of the archlinux repository's is signed ( needs pyalpm)

### Archlinux Scripts
Both oldbugs and unassignedbugs are two python scripts that are usefull for bug assigning work. The first script mails me a list of bugs that are openend since a custom date. This date can be defined in config.cfg, default_config.cfg is an example config file. 

Unassignedbugs, is a script that emails me all the unassigned bugs on Archlinux's bugtracker.
